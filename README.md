# Encrypto
I was looking for something to do when I came across the [dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher) encryption site. So I decided to make basic text encryption application made in Windows Forms and C#. I used the caesar shift method to encrypt the text, which is one of the most easy and most famous encryption systems, that uses the substitution of a letter by another one further in the alphabet. Now I can send secret strings! üòÅ
